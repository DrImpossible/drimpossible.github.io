## <a name="biography" id="biography"></a>About Me

Hi! Iâ€™m Ameya, and since you're reading this: a-may-yeah (as in __a__ book, __may__ I?, __yeah__ sure!). "Ameya" is the sanskrit word "à¤…à¤®à¥‡à¤¯" approximately translating to "Impossible". Just too full of energy as a baby, right? My parents went from "You're impossible" to "You're Ameya". This github username was created when in high school, as a battle against the impossible dream of being "Dr. Ameya" (pun intended) and motivation for it. The username is *not* the snobbish "I'm Dr. Ameya" not "Mr. Ameya", I never imagined I would actually make it from my circumstances.

Everyone has a core sthick, hereâ€™s mine: I am on a lifelong quest to execute *dope* projects, a.k.a. **Ideas** **which** **pay** **rent** ðŸ’–! I do not theorize about the *hypothetical*, or getting conspicuously upset at anything  without doing anything substantial to help.

Professionally, I love to think about technology and mechanism design-- How to better bake nicer incentives into decentralized technologies for a fairer world. I aspire to an the ideal of "theoretically grounded approaches should go hand-in-hand with challenging practical problems" in my research: Principled approaches can accelerate research compared to extensive hit-and-try approaches popular today. Conversely, it's important to make real-world assumptions to model computationally hard problems and side-step worst-case complexity. As [Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groucho_Marx) once famously said "Those are my principles, and if you don't like them.. well, I have others".  I work on data-centric investigations of emergence in large foundation models, with a focus on real-world tasks at BethgeLab in TÃ¼bingen AI Center!

On the fun side, I'm all about [fake frameworks](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wDP4ZWYLNj7MGXWiW/in-praise-of-fake-frameworks) â€” after all, ontologies make everything seem so real! My academic alter ego is an ENTJ, ruled by Te and Ni in the [Jungian world](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/27/on-types-of-typologies/). If you know your [Magic: The Gathering colors](https://medium.com/s/story/the-mtg-color-wheel-c9700a7cf36d), I'm mostly Blue and Red with a hint of Black. I'm a voracious reader [of](https://www.lesswrong.com/) [aspiring](https://slatestarcodex.com/)-[rationalist](http://gwern.net/), [effective](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/)-[altruism](https://80000hours.org/), [pop](https://marginalrevolution.com/)-[economics](https://www.econtalk.org/) blogs. I have heavy auditory bent for enjoyment in the auditory-visual-touch axis, and I'm heavily into Techno! I'm a semi-professional DJ, learning a Novation MK2 launchpad, and into dancing-- currently learning to shuffle. Dancing allows a mode of unbelievable expression through body language and I am super excited about it! My political views are a bit unconventional: I'm an anarchist in my personal interactions, a communist at home, a social democrat at the local/regional level, and a classical liberal on the national/global stage. I'm passionate about animal welfare, keeping internet free and avoiding unhalthy domination by both governments and large corporations, and I love and shill free and open-source culture.  Welcome to my personal page folks!
