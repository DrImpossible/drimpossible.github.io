## <a name="biography" id="biography"></a>About Me

Hi! I’m Ameya, and since you're reading this: a-may-yeah (as in __a__ book, __may__ I?, __yeah__ sure!). "Ameya" is the sanskrit word "अमेय" approximately translating to "Impossible". Just too full of energy as a baby, right? My parents went from "You're impossible" to "You're Ameya". This github username was created when in high school, as a battle against the impossible dream of being "Dr. Ameya" (pun intended) and motivation for it.

I love to think about technology and mechanism design-- How to better bake nicer incentives into decentralized technologies for a fairer world. I aspire to an the ideal of "theoretically grounded approaches should go hand-in-hand with challenging practical problems" in my research: Principled approaches can accelerate research compared to extensive hit-and-try approaches popular today. Conversely, it's important to make real-world assumptions to model computationally hard problems and side-step worst-case complexity. As [Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groucho_Marx) once famously said "Those are my principles, and if you don't like them.. well, I have others".  I work on effective methods for addressing continual learning at Torr Vision Group, University of Oxford.

On the personal side, I love [fake frameworks](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wDP4ZWYLNj7MGXWiW/in-praise-of-fake-frameworks): afterall ontologies make things seem real. The [jungian personality type](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/27/on-types-of-typologies/) of the academic me is currently ENTJ, dominated by Te and Ni; or my [MTG Color Wheel](https://medium.com/s/story/the-mtg-color-wheel-c9700a7cf36d) results have been dominated by Blue and Red with a Black tinge. I do read a lot [of](https://www.lesswrong.com/) [aspiring](https://slatestarcodex.com/)-[rationalist](http://gwern.net/), [effective](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/)-[altruism](https://80000hours.org/), [pop](https://marginalrevolution.com/)-[economics](https://www.econtalk.org/) blogrolls. I love EDM music and everything around it: I am a huge fan of techno along with house and trance music. I am semi-professional DJ, play a launchpad (Novation MK2) and am learning to shuffle. I have weird political leaning that I think more people should have: I am an anarchist in interpersonal interactions, communist at home, socialist democrat at local/regional level and classical liberal at the national/global level. The issues I deeply care about are animal welfare, digital privacy, slow science and the free and open source culture. Welcome to my personal page folks!
