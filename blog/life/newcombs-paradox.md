Here, I link things which I mostly agree with other people's take and don't have much to add.

I agree with [Scott Aaronson's](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=30) line of thought for the newcomb's problem, both in which I belong currently to the third-boring-wittgensteinian camp. [Gelman's statistical version](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2006/03/27/newcombs_parado/) of it was another interesting take.
