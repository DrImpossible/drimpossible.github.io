Here, I link things which I mostly agree with other people's take and don't have much to add.

[Newcomb's paradox](http://kops.uni-konstanz.de/handle/123456789/3451): It seems to me a clear, nice example to seperate two schools of decision theories but not a crucial problem in decision theory as motivated by Ledwig. Think of the blue-or-gold-dress which states a specific point or halting problem which illustrates the fact that some problems exist which are uncomputable, with each paradox having varying degrees of beauty and importance: halting problem being crucial while blue-gold-dress being not important and newcomb problem lying near the blue-gold-dress end of the spectrum rather than halting problem end.  Overall, I liked [Scott Aaronson's](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=30) line of thought for the newcomb's problem, both in which I belong currently to the third-boring-wittgensteinian camp. [Gelman's statistical version](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2006/03/27/newcombs_parado/) of it was another interesting take.
