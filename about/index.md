## <a name="biography" id="biography"></a>About Me

Hi! I’m Ameya, and since you're reading this: a-may-yeah (as in __a__ book, __may__ I?, __yeah__ sure!). "Ameya" is the sanskrit word "अमेय" approximately translating to "Impossible". Just too full of energy as a baby, right? My parents went from "You're impossible" to "You're Ameya". This github username was created when in high school, as a battle against the impossible dream of being "Dr. Ameya" (pun intended) and motivation for it.



Speaking of homegrounds, I aspire to an the ideal of "theoretically grounded approaches should go hand-in-hand with challenging practical problems" in my research: Principled approaches can accelerate research compared to extensive hit-and-try approaches popular today. Conversely, it's important to make real-world assumptions to model computationally hard problems and side-step worst-case complexity. As [Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groucho_Marx) once famously said "Those are my principles, and if you don't like them.. well, I have others".

On the fun side, I love [fake frameworks](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wDP4ZWYLNj7MGXWiW/in-praise-of-fake-frameworks), afterall ontologies make things seem real. On that note, I do read a lot [of](https://www.lesswrong.com/) [aspiring](https://slatestarcodex.com/)-[rationalist](https://www.overcomingbias.com/), [effective](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/)-[altruism](https://80000hours.org/), [pop](https://marginalrevolution.com/)-[economics](https://www.econtalk.org/) blogrolls. Now, some of these blogs lean right, while others lean left but I'm staunchly apolitical. That's simply because no serious political following in issues I deeply care about such as animal welfare, digital privacy, slow science or the free and open source movements. Since we're wayy into categorizing, the [jungian personality type](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/27/on-types-of-typologies/) of the academic me has consistently been INTP, dominated by Ti and Ne; or my [MTG Color Wheel](https://medium.com/s/story/the-mtg-color-wheel-c9700a7cf36d) results have been dominated by Blue and Red with a White tinge. If this last paragraph interests you more than anything above it, here is the [non-academic me](https://bayesiankitten.github.io/about/) where you might find more of the same. Welcome to my personal page folks!
