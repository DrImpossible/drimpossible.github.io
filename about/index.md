## <a name="biography" id="biography"></a>About Me

Hi! I’m Ameya, and since you're reading this: a-may-yeah (as in __a__ book, __may__ I?, __yeah__ sure!). "Ameya" is the sanskrit word "अमेय" approximately translating to "Impossible". Just too full of energy as a baby, right? My parents went from "You're impossible" to "You're Ameya". This github username was created when in high school, as a battle against the impossible dream of being "Dr. Ameya" (pun intended) and motivation for it.

I like to think about **the future** in general, currently intrigued by intelligent assistance (IA), computational economics, automated theorem provers and constitutional law. I want to dedicate my career towards designing principled algorithms to acquire more general notions of "learnability" and help better automating tasks (like proving tedious theorems) and also assist humans for other stuff. Serious researchers think it's cute when I talk about most of the above: including price theory, mechanism design, etc. I'm nevertheless excited by these fields and their insights.

Speaking of homegrounds, I aspire to an the ideal of "theoretically grounded approaches should go hand-in-hand with challenging practical problems": Principled approaches can accelerate research compared to extensive hit-and-try approaches popular today. Conversely, it's important to make real-world assumptions to model computationally hard problems and side-step worst-case complexity. As [Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groucho_Marx) once famously said "Those are my principles, and if you don't like them.. well, I have others".

On the fun side, the [jungian personality type](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/27/on-types-of-typologies/) of the academic me has consistently been INTP, dominated by Ti and Ne; or my [MTG Color Wheel](https://medium.com/s/story/the-mtg-color-wheel-c9700a7cf36d) results have been dominated by Blue and Red with a White tinge. I just love [fake frameworks](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wDP4ZWYLNj7MGXWiW/in-praise-of-fake-frameworks), afterall ontologies make things seem real. If this last paragraph interests you more than anything above it, here is the [non-academic me](https://bayesianconspirator.github.io/about/) where you might find more of the same. Welcome to my personal page folks!

## <a name="achievements" id="achievements"></a>Achievements

### 2020

* Got oustanding reviewer award for ECCV 2020!
* My research on issues with continual learning [**GDumb: A Simple Approach that Questions Our Progress in Continual Learning**]() got accepted at ECCV 2020 (Oral) (Acceptance rate: 2\%).
* Got outstanding reviewer award for CVPR 2020 (Acceptance rate: 4% :P)!

### 2019

* My research on active learning on text classification [**Sampling Bias in Deep Active Classification: An Empirical Study**](https://github.com/drimpossible/drimpossible.github.io/blob/master/documents/Active-Sampling-Bias.pdf) got accepted at EMNLP 2019.

[**My thesis**](https://github.com/drimpossible/drimpossible.github.io/blob/master/documents/Thesis.pdf) focused on developing principled approaches for sparse connectivity (pruning) and methods to exploit fast-binary convolutions for building efficient but accurate deep networks.
* Got outstanding reviewer award for CVPR 2019! Here is the [reviewer guideline](/blog/life/reviewing_for_dummies/) I developed for reference.
* I'm pursuing a PhD in Machine Learning at University of Oxford, one small step towards achieving my big goal.
